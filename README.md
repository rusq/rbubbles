# Bubbles

This library provides some UI components to build text user interfaces.  It
uses [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) as the underlying
framework.

It is written mainly to be used in [Slackdump](github.com/rusq/slackdump), but
it can be used in any other project.

Pull requests are welcome.
